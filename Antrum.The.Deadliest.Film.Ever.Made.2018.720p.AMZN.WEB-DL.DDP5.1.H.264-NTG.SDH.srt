Narrator: In 1988
a small movie theatre in

10
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:15,627
Budapest, Hungary
burnt to the ground.

11
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:20,045
Bystanders that had witnessed
the event described it as if the

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,499
building had spontaneously
erupted into a monument of fire.

Killing the 56 people who
were watching the film.

00:01:30,262 --> 00:01:33,196
The film that was screening
was called "Antrum".

15
00:01:58,773 --> 00:02:02,708
AJ Bond: It was released in
one theatre and it burnt down.

16
00:02:02,743 --> 00:02:07,472
It's kind of the holy grail
of underground cult films that

17
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:11,786
no-one has seen, except for
a handful of film festival

And the rumor is that the
film is cursed

watches it will die.

Carpenter's TV movie "Cigarette

all about movies
that kill people.

25
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,912
But Antrum is that movie.

a young girl in a forest,
digging a hole to hell.

29
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,613
Narrator: In 1983 the film was
submitted to film festivals

30
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:47,960
across the United States.

31
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:50,446
It is known that it was
submitted to at least

32

7 festivals, from which it was
rejected and never received

AJ Bond: It was like
the work of the devil.

35
00:02:59,903 --> 00:03:01,595
It's like the devil

Narrator: Several of the

suffered a fatal or near fatal
incident shortly

after screening Antrum.

possible for an art form to

47
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,634
change the physical
being of a human?

48
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:44,396
This is since day one, since
Greek times when we had theaters

49
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:46,502
and hospitals next
to each other,

50
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:50,816
and people go to hospitals
watching shows to actually heal.

51
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:54,441
So is that possible for an art
to have the opposite effect?

52
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:57,789
Absolutely yes.

Colorado Film Festival suffered

Narrator: The final deadly event
that transpired before the films

77
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:14,831
mysterious disappearance
occurred in San Francisco

78
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:17,938
in November of 1993.

79
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:23,184
The film's growing notoriety as
'the movie that kills' enticed a

80
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:26,671
local movie theatre to screen
the film.

81
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:29,156
The audience was well aware of
the film's alleged curse,

82
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,986
before they entered their seats.

83
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:36,474
Shortly after Antrum began the
mood in the audience turned from

84
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:40,374
playful amusement to
a palpable anxiety.

85
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:44,999
This growing anxiety amongst the
crowd escalated into a stampede

86
00:05:45,034 --> 00:05:47,381
towards the theatre exits.

87
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:50,798
Which had all
unexpectedly been locked.

88
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:54,699
This had created an all-out
panic where a large number of

89
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:59,738
people started rioting and
viciously fighting one another.

90

Resulting in over 30 injuries
and the trampling

and death of a pregnant woman.

93
00:06:08,437 --> 00:06:11,681
Narrator: Later toxicity tests
revealed that the majority of

94
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:16,410
the audience had ingested
lysergic acid diethylamide.

95
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:20,034
Or LSD. Yet every patron
insisted

96
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:22,243
they did not take the drug.

97
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:25,868
Upon further investigation,
Richard Samy,

98
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:29,596
an employee confessed to
slipping large portions of the

99
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,323
drug into popcorn
butter that night.

[music]

108
00:06:56,657 --> 00:06:59,522
Narrator: The producers of this
film have successfully tracked

109
00:06:59,557 --> 00:07:04,734
down a sole copy of Antrum at an
estate auction in Connecticut.

110
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:08,704
The print revealed itself to be
typical of a film shot in the

111
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:14,468
late 1970s on 35mm stock,
with the exception of notable

112
00:07:14,503 --> 00:07:19,715
peculiarities found both in
the film's sound and picture.

113
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:24,892
Analysis suggests that these
peculiarities are deliberate and

114
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:28,413
designed to provoke both a
physical and psychological

115

effect in the viewer.

116
00:07:30,622 --> 00:07:33,314
There are
reasons to suggest that since

117
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:35,765
this print has been
in circulation,

118
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,666
some unknown third parties have
manipulated it as there are

119
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,601

appears to be un-related and

00:07:47,536 --> 00:07:50,055
Since the producers of
this film are unsure about

00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,506
the origins of this material.

123

into the physical print of the
film,

01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:20,191
provoke a physical and

Auditory illusions that
stimulate specific frequencies

648

within the brain.

649
01:28:30,339 --> 01:28:31,661
Brock Fricker: Well
binaural beats,

650
01:28:31,685 --> 01:28:32,869
a lot of people over the
years have studied

651
01:28:32,893 --> 01:28:34,309
sub-sonic frequencies.

652
01:28:34,343 --> 01:28:36,587
What you hear is
maybe 500 cycles.

653
01:28:36,621 --> 01:28:39,521
But if one's at 500 cycles, the
frequency on the left side And

654
01:28:39,555 --> 01:28:43,456
the frequency on the right side
is maybe 504 cycles,

655
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:48,046
your brain would
pick up on 4 cycles.

656
01:28:48,081 --> 01:28:52,948
And 4 cycles could induce
some kind of a state.

657
01:28:52,982 --> 01:28:57,366
They can make you enter into a
state of euphoria like a high.

658
01:28:57,401 --> 01:29:01,370
Others can cause you
to feel very anxious.

659
01:29:01,405 --> 01:29:05,132
And supposedly
certain frequencies,

660
01:29:05,167 --> 01:29:07,238
if they're loud enough, can
even cause you to

661
01:29:07,272 --> 01:29:10,206
have nervous breakdown.

01:29:10,241 --> 01:29:13,969

[Oralee Screaming]

664
01:29:19,664 --> 01:29:23,358
Narrator: A more puzzling
peculiarity was that over the

665
01:29:23,392 --> 01:29:25,808
original print there was an
invisible layer of some type of

666
01:29:25,843 --> 01:29:33,057
thin plastic, Cut and fitted
precisely over frames.

667
01:29:33,091 --> 01:29:35,266
Tabitha Zhu: Those are sigils.

668
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:38,303
So sigils and symbols
are said to hold an

669
01:29:38,338 --> 01:29:40,340
emotional power over people.

670
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:43,619
You don't have to be consciously
aware of these associations to

671
01:29:43,654 --> 01:29:45,138
be influenced by it.

672
01:29:45,172 --> 01:29:50,661
These associations, they
are deeply embedded in the

673
01:29:50,695 --> 01:29:54,561
collective unconscious
of human culture.

674
01:29:54,596 --> 01:29:58,323
For example, something as simple
and commonplace as a triangle

675
01:29:58,358 --> 01:29:59,404
carries with it powers with
special associations.

676
01:29:59,428 --> 01:30:03,087
For example, in the western
world the triangle

677
01:30:03,121 --> 01:30:07,781
is associated with trinity - the
father, the son and holy ghost.

678
01:30:07,816 --> 01:30:10,508
In the Eastern cultures the
triangle means

679
01:30:10,543 --> 01:30:13,304
manifestation and illumination.

680
01:30:13,338 --> 01:30:16,514
And for the occult, the
triangle is a summoning symbol.

681
01:30:16,549 --> 01:30:18,171
Interviewer: A summoning symbol?

682
01:30:18,205 --> 01:30:19,459
Tabitha Zhu: Exactly,
a summoning symbol.

683
01:30:19,483 --> 01:30:21,450
Interviewer: To summon...?

684
01:30:21,485 --> 01:30:25,868
Tabitha Zhu: To summon,
The devil or whomever...

685
01:30:25,903 --> 01:30:28,319
Dr. Ivan Gaston: You know I'm
familiar with the particular

686
01:30:28,353 --> 01:30:32,841
sigil of symbol that
is used in Antrum.

687
01:30:32,875 --> 01:30:38,605
Basically it's an evocation
to call upon one of 72 demons.

688
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:43,196
In this case the particular
sigil that's in the film belongs

689
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:47,994
to the demon Astaroth.

690
01:30:48,028 --> 01:30:52,377
It's from a grimoire,
a spell book.

691
01:30:52,412 --> 01:30:59,246
It acts as an invitation to
whoever is exposed to the sigil.

692
01:30:59,281 --> 01:31:02,940
Basically its saying
'do you want to play?'

693
01:31:02,974 --> 01:31:04,976

694
01:31:23,029 --> 01:31:25,687
Dr. Ivan Gaston: In the village
of Laon in France back

695
01:31:25,721 --> 01:31:27,516
in the mid 17th century.

696
01:31:27,551 --> 01:31:30,588
A group of magicians believed
that the children of the village

697
01:31:30,623 --> 01:31:33,418
were more in league with
The Devil than with God.

698
01:31:33,453 --> 01:31:39,390
So, they decided
to evoke Astaroth.

699
01:31:39,424 --> 01:31:42,531
Now nothing was heard from
the village for about 2 weeks.

700
01:31:42,566 --> 01:31:47,329
They found every man,
woman and child in church,

701
01:31:47,363 --> 01:31:48,986
sitting in church, with their
mouths open

702
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:53,646
as if beatifically singing.

703
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:58,892
Only thing was that
they were all dead,

704
01:31:58,927 --> 01:32:03,103
they had been murdered.

705
01:32:03,138 --> 01:32:07,487
Now in the main square, they
found the magicians walking

706
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:10,801
in a circle, holding onto their
eyes.

707
01:32:10,835 --> 01:32:15,564
They had gouged
out their own eyes.

708
01:32:15,599 --> 01:32:19,464
That is the power of Astaroth.

709
01:32:24,987 --> 01:32:28,681
Tabitha Zhu: I don't think a
sigil or a symbol or in this

710
01:32:28,715 --> 01:32:32,823
case a movie can
physically harm someone.

711
01:32:32,857 --> 01:32:36,343
But it is widely known that
beliefs can

712
01:32:36,378 --> 01:32:38,483
strongly influence people.

713
01:32:38,518 --> 01:32:42,591
For example, the Kurdaitcha, who
is a ritual executioner

714
01:32:42,626 --> 01:32:45,801
of an aboriginal tribe in
Australia.

715
01:32:45,836 --> 01:32:48,666
All he has to do is point a bone
at a victim

716
01:32:48,701 --> 01:32:51,358
and the person
quickly becomes apathetic,

717
01:32:51,393 --> 01:32:54,430
unresponsive and death occurs
within days

718
01:32:54,465 --> 01:32:58,469
of being "cursed" so to speak.

719
01:32:58,503 --> 01:33:01,230
But it is a psycho-somatic
response to what the medical

720
01:33:01,265 --> 01:33:06,028
community refers to as
a self-willed death.

721
01:33:07,892 --> 01:33:13,588
Asen Gadjalov: I believe
in the power of the fear.

722
01:33:13,622 --> 01:33:18,558
And the way the fear
works with people.

723
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:22,562
I do believe that people can
make themselves believe so much

724
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:27,843
in things, that they can turn
those things into truth and

725
01:33:27,878 --> 01:33:31,882
that imagined truth, or
this imagined feeling,

726
01:33:31,916 --> 01:33:37,715
which could be fear,
Can end their life.

727
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:42,340
